# Delta-Sigma-Modulator-System-Modeling-MATLAB-Simulink-
This repository contains a modular MATLAB/Simulink toolbox to build current-mode ΔΣ modulators (1st–3rd order), automation scripts to sweep OSR and quantizer resolution, data extraction (ENOB/SNR/NTF), example usage and plotting utilities. The Simulink models are generated programmatically to keep the repo text-based.
